I loved how Blender lets you grab nodes without precisely hovering over them - just press a key, move them, and press again to release. It saves so many clicks! After searching online and asking around with no success, I decided to create it myself, with a little help from Claude AI."

Instead of having to hover over the node, I just press a button and it grabs the nodes - I can offset them without caring about the cursor position. When I press the button again, it releases. Could we create something like this for Nuke?",
