      content: `My journey started with Claude AI. As someone who isn't a professional programmer, 
        I discovered that Claude could:
        ‚Ä¢ Break down complex problems into manageable steps
        ‚Ä¢ Explain After Effects' scripting API in simple terms
        ‚Ä¢ Suggest best practices and optimizations
        ‚Ä¢ Help debug issues when I got stuck
        
        The key was asking specific questions and iteratively improving the code. Claude became
        like a patient mentor, helping me understand not just what to code, but why certain
        approaches work better than others.`

        ‚Ä¢ Used EEAct (React framework for After Effects)
        ‚Ä¢ Created reusable components for common tasks
        ‚Ä¢ Implemented a clean, modern design
        ‚Ä¢ Added smooth animations and transitions

      content: `One of the most powerful aspects of building the panel in React is that we can 
        preview and test it directly in a web browser. Since both the After Effects panel and 
        this blog are built with React, we can:
        ‚Ä¢ Display the exact same components in both environments
        ‚Ä¢ Test functionality without launching After Effects
        ‚Ä¢ Share demos with stakeholders easily
        ‚Ä¢ Iterate on designs quickly
        
        The demos above aren't just mockups - they're running the actual panel code, 
        just without the After Effects-specific functionality. This demonstrates React's 
        flexibility and the power of component-based architecture.`

        summary: `By combining these tools - Claude AI, Cursor IDE, React, GitHub, and Discord - 
          I created something more powerful than I initially imagined. What started as a simple
          automation project became a full-featured production tool that our whole team uses daily.
          
          The ability to preview and test the panel in a web browser made development significantly 
          faster and more collaborative. It's a perfect example of how modern web technologies 
          can enhance traditional desktop software.`,
